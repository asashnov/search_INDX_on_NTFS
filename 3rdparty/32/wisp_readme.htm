<hr/><!---------------------About the <b><i>wisp</i></b> Tool---------------------->
<h2><a name="about">About the <b><i>wisp</i></b> Tool</a>
<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>

<div>
<p>          
<b><i>wisp</i></b> is a command line version of a Windows parser that targets 
NTFS index type attributes.  The NTFS index attribute points 
to one or more <i>INDX</i> records.  These records contain index 
entries that are used to account for each item in a directory. 
An index item represents either a file or a subdirectory and 
includes enough metadata to contain the name, modified/access/MFT 
changed/birth (<i>MACB</i>) timestamps, size (if it is a file vice 
subdirectory), as well as MFT entry numbers of the item and 
its parent.   The <b><i>wisp</i></b> tool, in its simplest form, is able 
to walk these structures, read the metadata, and report which 
index entries are present.</p>

<p>  
As a directory's contents are changed, the number of valid 
index entries grows or shrinks, as appropriate.   As more 
directory entries are added, eventually it will exceed the 
existing <i>INDX</i> record allocation space.  At this point the 
operating system will allocate an additional <i>INDX</i> record in 
the size of 0x1000 byte chunk.  Conversely, when entries are 
removed from the directory, the <i>INDX</i> record space is not 
necessarily deallocated.  Thus, anytime the number of index 
entries shrinks, the invalid ones potentially can be harvested
from the <i>slack</i> space.  The <i>slack</i> space is defined to be the 
allocated but unused space.  By comparing both the valid 
entries and those still in the <i>slack</i> space, one can make 
some inferences about whether a file (or subdirectory) was 
present in the past.</p>     

<p>  
A good tutorial on harvesting index entries from INDX slack space 
can be found on Willi Ballenthin's webpage 
<a href="http://www.williballenthin.com/forensics/indx/index.html">[4]</a> 
and his DFIRonline presentation 
<a href="http://writeblocked.org/dfironline.html">[5]</a>.</p>  

<p>  
<b><i>wisp</i></b> uses the NTFS and index attribute parsing engine that 
is used in the <b><i>ntfswalk</i></b> tool 
<a href="http://tzworks.net/prototype_page.php?proto_id=12">[6]</a> 
available from the <i>TZWorks 
LLC</i> website.  Currently there are compiled versions for 
Windows, Linux and Mac OS-X.</p>

<p>To use this tool, an authentication file is required to be in the same 
directory as the binary for the tool to run.  The non-commercial/demonstrational-use 
EULA is part of this readme. It only activates certain capabilities of the 
tool and is meant only for demonstration purposes.  This authentication will 
eventually expire.  To activate all the functionality of the tool and use 
it on a permanent basis, a separate business license needs to be purchased. 
Contact <a href="mailto:info@tzworks.net">info&#64;tzworks.net</a> for more 
details about the using this tool for business and/or casework use.</p>
</div>

<hr/><!---------------------How to use this Tool---------------------->
<h2><a name="howto">How to use this Tool</a>
<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>

<div>
<p> 
While the <b><i>wisp</i></b> tool doesn't require one to run with 
administrator privileges, without doing so will restrict 
one to only looking at off-line <i>'dd'</i> images.  Therefore 
to perform <i>live</i> processing of volumes, one needs to launch
the command prompt with administrator privileges.</p> 

<p> 
One can display the menu options by typing in the 
executable name with no parameters.  From the available 
options, one can process NTFS <i>INDX</i> records with a 
handful of 'use-cases'.  Specifically, <b><i>wisp</i></b> allows 
processing from any of these sources: (a) <i>live</i> volume, 
(b) <i>'dd'</i> type image, (c) <i>VMWare</i> volume or (d) separately 
extracted <i>INDX</i> type record.</p> 

<p> 
After selecting the source of the data, one can either: (a)
process a single directory on the file system, (b) recursively 
process the subdirectories to some specified level, or 
(c) process all the index entries in an entire volume.  
Processing every directory in the entire volume is not 
explicitly shown in the above menu since it is the 
default option.</p>    

<p> 
If one only wants a certain type of index entry, one 
can select: (a) just show valid index entries, (b) just 
show index entries in the <i>slack</i> space, or (c) both.  
For default output, one can select nothing.  This will output 
the data in unstructured text.  If parsable output is desired 
(or something that can be displayed in a spreadsheet application), 
one can select from 3 options that allow for structured output  (CSV, 
<i><a href="http://log2timeline.net/">log2timeline</a></i> CSV, 
or 
<i><a href="http://wiki.sleuthkit.org/index.php?title=Body_file">SleuthKit body-file</a></i>).  
The other useful option is 
the 'no duplicates' choice to minimize any redundancy 
in the output.</p> 
</div>

<hr/><!---------------------Parsing a Live Volume---------------------->
<h2><a name="live_vol">Parsing a Live Volume</a>
<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>

<div>
<p>
To parse <i>INDX</i> entries from a <i>live</i> NTFS volume (or 
partition), one has two choices: (a) specify the 
volume directly by using the <font color="red">-partition &lt;drive letter&gt;</font> 
option or (b) specify the drive number and volume 
offset by using the <font color="red">-drivenum &lt;num&gt; -offset &lt;volume 
offset&gt;</font> option.  Either choice accomplishes the same 
task.  The first choice is more straightforward and 
easier to use.  The second choice, while more complex, 
allows one to target hidden NTFS partitions that do 
not have a drive letter.</p>  

<p>
The next step is to decide what you want to target.  The choices are:  
(a) a specific directory on the file system (specified 
by either the <font color="red">-mft</font> or <font color="red">-path</font> options), (b) a collection 
of subdirectories within a directory (how deep you wish to go is specified by 
the <font color="red">-level</font> option) or (c) all directories (specified 
by the <font color="red">-scanall</font> option).  A couple examples are shown below:</p>

<pre>
    <b><i>wisp</i></b> -partition c -path c:\$Recycle.Bin -level 2 -all -csv &gt; results1.csv
    <b><i>wisp</i></b> -drivenum 0 -offset 0x100000 -all -csv &gt; results2.csv
</pre>

<p>
The first example targets the hidden directory of 
c:\$Recycle.Bin, and the <font color="red">-level 2</font> switch tells <b><i>wisp</i></b> to 
include any subdirectory in the analysis, up to 2 levels 
deep.   The <font color="red">-all</font> switch means both valid and invalid 
(<i>slack</i>) entries will be included in the output.  Finally, 
the output is redirected to a file and the format is CSV.</p>

<p>
The second example uses the same output options as the 
first, but now targets the first physical hard drive.  
The hex value 0x100000 is specified as the offset to 
the volume (or partition) we wish to analyze.  For this 
example, this happens to be the hidden partition created 
during a Windows 7 installation.   Since there is no 
<font color="red">-mft</font> or <font color="red">-path</font> options explicitly listed, the implication 
to <b><i>wisp</i></b> is we want to traverse the entire volume parsing 
all <i>INDX</i> records associated with the volume.</p>  
</div>

<hr/><!---------------------Parsing an Image File off-line---------------------->
<h2><a name="offline_vol">Parsing an Image File off-line</a>
<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>

<div>
<p>
To process an image that has been already acquired and is 
in the <i>'dd'</i> format, one uses the <font color="red">-image</font> switch.  This option 
can be used in two flavors.  If the image is of an entire 
drive then one needs to explicitly specify the offset of 
the location of the volume you wish to target.  On the other 
hand, if the image is only of a volume, then you do not 
need to specify the offset of the volume (since it is 
presumed to be at offset 0).   </p>  

<p>
For the first case, where 
an offset needs to be explicitly specified, <b><i>wisp</i></b> will help 
the user in locating where the NTFS volume offsets are.
If one just issues the <font color="red">-image</font> command without the offset, 
and there is not a NTFS volume at offset 0 (eg. second 
case mentioned above), <b><i>wisp</i></b> will proceed to look at the 
master boot record contained in the image, determine where the NTFS partitions 
are, and report them to the user.  This behavior was meant 
to be an aid to the user so that one does not need to 
resort to other tools to determine where the offsets for 
the NTFS volumes are in an image. </p>  


<p>
Another nuance with using images as the source, is when 
specifying a path to a directory within the image to analyze, 
using the <font color="red">-path</font> option.   Since the image is not mounted as 
a drive, one really should not associate it with a drive 
letter when specifying the path.  If one does do this, <b><i>wisp</i></b> 
will ignore the drive letter and proceed to try to find the 
path starting at the root directory which is at MFT entry 5 
for NTFS volumes.</p> 

<p>
Below are two examples of processing <i>'dd'</i> type images:  
(a) the first analyzes an entire volume at drive offset 
0x100000 hex and (b) the second analyzes an image of a volume 
starting at the path "Users".</p>  

<pre>
    <b><i>wisp</i></b> -image c:\dump\my_image.dd -offset 0x100000 -all -csv &gt; results1.csv
    <b><i>wisp</i></b> -image c:\dump\vol_image.dd -path "\Users" -level 5 -all -csv &gt; results2.csv
</pre>

<p>
While the first example traverses the entire volume, the 
second starts at the "Users" directory and 
recursively processes the subdirectories up to 5 levels deep.  
Notice the second example does not specify an offset, since 
the image is of a volume (meaning the volume starts at offset 
0) while the first is an image of a drive and the first NTFS 
volume starts at offset 0x100000 hex.</p>

<p>
Both examples extract valid and invalid index entries as 
well as redirect their output to a file using CSV formatting.</p>
</div>

<hr/><!---------------------Parsing a NTFS Volume Mounted on Linux or Mac OS-XParsing a VMWare volume---------------------->
<h2><a name="mounted">Parsing a NTFS Volume Mounted on Linux or Mac OS-X</a>
<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>

<div>
<p>
Sometimes you do not have a '<i>dd</i>' image of a volume or drive, but instead have the 
physical hard drive available you 
wish to analyze.  If you are running <b><i>wisp</i></b> in Windows, then one can mount
the physical dirve and proceed to follow the 
guidelines in the earlier section for parsing a <i>live</i> volume.  However, 
if you are running <b><i>wisp</i></b> in Linux or Mac OS-X, you should also be 
able to mount the target drive as well. Once it is successfully mounted, 
one uses the 
<font color="red">-image &lt;device name of drive or volume&gt; -offset 
&lt;offset to desired volume, if a drive&gt;</font> option to access the 
appropriate NTFS volume.  Below is an example of how to do this using a Mac box.  </p>

<p>
Assuming one has the proper setup with write blocker and hard drive 
shuttle, after connecting the Windows drive to the Mac, one can 
issue the <b><i>diskutil list</i></b> command to enumerate all the drives and 
volumes mounted on the machine. For this example, lets also assume the 
drive that we mounted was labeled as /dev/disk1 and its 
NTFS partition was /dev/disk1s1.  From this data one could issue the following
command to <b><i>wisp</i></b> to analyze the partition.</p>

<pre>
    sudo <b><i>wisp</i></b> -image /dev/<font color="red">r</font>disk1s1 -all -csv -nodups &gt; out.csv
</pre>

Notice the '<i>sudo</i>' in front of the <b><i>wisp</i></b> command.  This 
will allow <b><i>wisp</i></b> to run with administrator privileges to access 
the raw drive.  Also note <i>/dev/<font color="red">r</font>disk1s1</i> 
is used.  The '<font color="red">r</font>' (which is unique to Mac, in this case) is used 
to specify we want to 
access the drive as <i>raw</i> I/O as opposed to <i>buffered</i> I/O. Buffered
I/O is nice for normal reads and/or writes, but it is much slower when 
traversing in chunks aligned on sector boundaries.

<p>
Linux is similar to Mac, but instead of using the <b><i>diskutil</i></b> 
tool, one would use the <b><i>df</i></b> tool to enumerate the mounted 
devices.</p>
</div>

<hr/><!---------------------Parsing a VMWare volume---------------------->
<h2><a name="vmware_vol">Parsing a VMWare volume</a>
<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>

<div>
<p>
Occasionally it is useful to analyze a <i>VMWare</i> image containing 
a Windows volume, both from a forensics standpoint as well as 
from a testing standpoint.  This option is still considered 
experimental since it has only been tested on a handful of 
configurations.  Furthermore, this option is limited to monolithic 
type <i>VMWare</i> images versus split images.   In <i>VMWare</i>, the term 
split image means the volume is separated into multiple files, 
while the term monolithic virtual disk is defined to be a 
virtual disk where everything is kept in one file.  There 
may be more than one VMDK file in a monolithic architecture, 
where each monolithic VMDK file would represent a separate 
snapshot.  More information about the monolithic virtual 
disk architecture can be obtained from the <i>VMWare</i> website 
<a href="http://www.vmware.com">[10]</a>.</p>

<p>
When working with virtual machines, the capability to 
handle snapshot images is important.  Thus, if processing a 
<i>VMWare</i> snapshot, one needs to include the snapshot/image 
as well as its inheritance chain.</p>   

<p>
To handle an inheritance chain, <b><i>wisp</i></b> can handle 
multiple VMDK files by listing all the vmdk files separated by
a pipe character and enclosed in double quotes.
(eg. <font color="red">-vmdk "&lt;VMWare NTFS virtual disk-1&gt; | ... | 
&lt;VMWare NTFS virtual disk-x&gt;"</font>).</p>

<p>
Aside from the VMDK inheritance chain, everything else is the 
same when using this option to that of normal <i>'dd'</i> type 
images discussed in the previous section.</p>
</div>

<hr/><!---------------------Extracting Clusters Associated with a Deleted Entry---------------------->
<h2><a name="ntfscopy">Extracting Clusters Associated with a Deleted Entry</a>
<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>

<div>
<p>
At this point in the analysis, one may want to go deeper and 
try to find if the deleted file is still available by trying 
to find the '<i>cluster run</i>' data associate with the MFT entry.  
Since the <i>INDX</i> records do not have any <i>cluster run</i> data 
associated with an index entry, one would need to use the MFT 
entry specified and then use some other tool to read the file 
record associated with that MFT entry.  One could extract the 
data either from the local volume or from the volume shadow 
copy store.  If pulling from the local volume, one can use 
the <b><i>ntfscopy</i></b> utility 
<a href="http://tzworks.net/prototype_page.php?proto_id=9">[7]</a> 
from <i>TZWorks</i>.  This tool will allow 
one to (a) input a volume (live or off-line), (b) specify the 
desired MFT entry to copy from and (c) output the extract the 
data associated with the MFT's <i>cluster run</i> as well as the 
metadata associated with that MFT entry.   Below is an 
example of doing this with <b><i>ntfscopy</i></b> using the MFT entry 
number 645130, which is for the <i>slack</i> entry shown above.</p> 

<pre>
    <b><i>ntfscopy</i></b> -mft 645130 -dst c:\dump\645130.bin -partition c: -meta
</pre>

<p>
For details on the <b><i>ntfscopy</i></b> syntax, refer to the <b><i>ntfscopy</i></b> 
readme file <a href="http://tzworks.net/prototype_page.php?proto_id=9">[7]</a>.   
Briefly, the -mft option allows one 
to specify a source MFT entry to copy from.  The -meta 
option says to create a separate file (in addition to the 
copied file) that contains the metadata information about 
the specified MFT entry.  The metadata file will be created 
with the same name as the destination file with the 
appended suffix .meta.txt.  Included in the metadata file 
are many of the NTFS attributes of the target source file 
(or MFT entry).  This includes, amongst other things, the 
<i>cluster run</i> and <i>MACB</i> timestamps.  From the metadata one 
can see if the MFT sequence number is the same or not (which 
would be the indication whether the MFT record was assigned 
to another file or not).</p>  
</div>

<hr/><!---------------------Eliminating the Duplicates---------------------->
<h2><a name="nodups">Eliminating the Duplicates</a>
<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>

<div>
<p>
For those <i>INDX</i> records that have many <i>slack</i> entries, it is 
not uncommon for there to be quite a few duplicate entries that 
are parsed and displayed in the output.   Duplicate here means 
the filename and <i>MACB</i> timestamps are the same, however the 
location of the entry in the <i>INDX</i> record is different.  For 
every unique location in the <i>INDX</i> record, <b><i>wisp</i></b> will happily 
parse the index entry and report its findings to the investigator.  
This can be quite annoying when some entries have more than a 
few duplicates and one is trying to wade through a lot of data; 
especially when carving out entries from <i>slack</i> data on all 
the directories in an entire volume.</p>  

<p>
To get rid of duplicates, one can invoke the -nodups switch.  
This tells <b><i>wisp</i></b> to analyze the data extracted and only report 
one instance of the entry.   One thing to be aware of when 
using this option, is that <b><i>wisp</i></b> will internally always analyze 
valid and <i>slack</i> entries independent of what the user selects 
as input options.  After all the data is extracted, <b><i>wisp</i></b> will 
start deciding if there are duplicate entries or not.   It 
does this by looking at comparing all <i>slack</i> entries with valid 
entries to see if there is a duplicate, and if not, they are 
compared to any <i>slack</i> entries that have been marked as non-dups.  
What this means is, if one runs <b><i>wisp</i></b> and only wants 
non-duplicate <i>slack</i> entries, some <i>slack</i> entries will not be 
reported if there are valid entries present that are the same.</p>

<h4>Which Output option yields the most data</h4>
<p>
The two output options that give all the metadata available 
are the default (unstructured) output and the CSV (<font color="red">-csv</font>)
output.  The other two output options (<font color="red">-csvl2t</font> and 
<font color="red">-bodyfile</font>) are geared toward generating cross-artifact 
timelines.   As a result, they are more restrictive in the 
output fields, and therefore, the metadata that is parsable 
from these options have some limitations.   Specifically, 
<b><i>wisp</i></b> makes use of a couple of free-form fields in these 
last two output options to try to inject as much useful 
data as possible, but it makes the data in these fields 
unstructured, and therefore, difficult to parse if trying 
to post process the results.  Therefore, the best 
option for metadata that needs to be parsed from <b><i>wisp</i></b> output 
comes from the <font color="red">-csv</font> option.</p>  

<h4>Two Categories of Slack entries</h4>
<p>
The slack entries in the output have comments associated with them.  
The comments come in 2 categories: (a) entries that have not been deleted 
and (b) those that have been deleted.</p>  

<p>
The first case there is a valid and invalid (slack) entry pointing to the 
same file (one can tell this since the MFT entry number and sequence 
numbers match up).  The difference, aside from the fact one is in 
slack space, is something has changed in the metadata from one file 
to the other.  This could be that <i>MACB</i> timestamps are different,
or the the size of the file has changed.   <b><i>wisp</i></b> annotates the 
time modifications with a comment, denoted by <i>[macb]</i> and/or <i>[size]</i>,
depending whether the MACB times are different or the size is different.
In the case of timestamps changing, <b><i>wisp</i></b> may put the following: <i>[m.c.]</i>, 
which translates to the modify timestamp and 'MFT change' 
timestamps, respectively, as being different than the valid entry.  
From this, one can get some past data on a file that has gone through 
some revisions.</p>    

<p>
For the second case, <b><i>wisp</i></b> 
just annotates the <i>slack</i> entry as deleted.  The term 
deleted here is only accurate in the sense that this index 
entry is no longer part of the directory containing the 
<i>INDX</i> record(s).  Whether the item was moved to another 
subdirectory or actually deleted is unknown from the data 
presented here.</p>  

<h4>Corruption of the Index Entry</h4>

<p>
In cases where there the slack data is obviously corrupted, <b><i>wisp</i></b> will 
either leave that field blank if using CSV output or annotate the word 
&lt;corrupted&gt; if using the default output.</p>

<div>
<p>
For CSV (comma separated values) output, there are restrictions 
in the characters that are outputted. Since commas are used as a 
separator, any data that had comma in its name are changed to spaces. 
For the default (non-csv) output no changes are made to the data.</p>

        restrictions with this option is a the colon (:) symbol needs to separate hours, minutes

        repeating symbol 'x' to represent number of fractional seconds. (note: the the fractional 
        seconds applies only to those time formats that have the appropriate precision available. 
        The Windows internal filetime has, for example, 100 nsec unit precision available. 
        The DOS time format and the UNIX 'time_t' format, however, have no fractional seconds). 
        Some of the times represented by for this tool may use a time format without fractional 
        seconds and therefore will not show a greater precision beyond seconds when using this 
        option.</td>

<hr/><!---------------------Authentication and License File---------------------->
<h2><a name="auth">Authentication and License File</a>
<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>

<div>
<p>This tool has authentication built into the binary.  There are two authentication 
mechanisms:  
(a) the digital certificate embedded into the binary and (b) the runtime authentication.   
For the first method, only the Windows and Mac OS-X (if available) versions have been 
signed by an X-509 digital code signing certificate, which is validated by Windows 
(or OS-X) during operation.  If the binary has been tampered with, the digital 
certificate will be invalidated.</p>

<p>For the second (runtime authentication) method, the authentication does two things: 
(a) validates that the tool has a valid license and (b) validates the 
tool's binary has not been corrupted.   The license needs to be in the same directory 
of the tool for it to authenticate.   Furthermore any modification to the license, 
either to its name or contents, will invalidate the license.   The runtime binary 
validation hashes the executable that is running and fails the authentication if it 
detects any modifications. </p>

<h4><i>Limited</i> vice <i>Full</i> in the tool's output banner</h4>

<p>The tools from TZWorks tools will output header information about the tool's version
and whether it is running in <i>limited</i> or <i>full</i> mode.  This is directly related
to what version of a license the tool authenticates with.   The <i>limited</i> keyword 
indicates some functionality of the tool is not available, and the <i>full</i> keyword 
indicates all the functionality is available.  The lacking functionality in the <i>limited</i>
version may mean one or more of the following: (a) certain options may not be available, 
(b) certain data may not be outputted in the parsed results, and (c) the license has a 
finite lifetime before expiring.</p>
